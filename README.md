Assignment   Details
Conduct digital research on an online   community to   examine   how   digital   media technologies and social relations are shaped and   produced   in   relation to each   other.
You will employ digital ethnographic   methods to create a   digital   ethnography   of   an online community of your choice. This online community   can   be   on   any   platform,   website, or   mobile app. You will   utilize the readings and   digital   ethnographic   methods   taught in the course to research this community and   create   a video   presentation   (power-point or short ﬁlm, or video   lecture) on your   research   and   analysis.
Oral   Exam: This   is a   10-minute oral exam between you and your   TA,   scheduled   on   either 6th or 8th August. You will   be tested on your   research, your   ethnographic   methods, and your engagement with the readings of the course towards the   development of your ﬁnal   project.
Video   Presentation: This   is a 7-10-minute video presentation, video   lecture, or short   ﬁlm or documentary that presents your research,   methods, and   analysis   using the concepts discussed throughout this course.
Your assignment   must   include primary   research   (explained below) as well   as   an   in-depth engagement   with any 4-5 texts and concepts from this   course. You   can   use   any   readings from   Modules   1, 2, and   3.
Primary   Research   Methods:
1.       Digital   Ethnographic   methods
•   Choose   a digital/online community.
This can be a multitude of things:   forum,   a YouTube   comments   section,   a blog,   a   reddit post and comments, an online   gaming   community,   groups   or   pages on Twitter, Weibo,   Facebook, TikTok, etc. Choose a digital/online community that is dynamic, i.e. users   are   regularly   participating through      posts, comments,   livestream attendance and   reactions, etc.   Ideally, your   chosen digital community will be one that you’re familiar with or   have some past experience with. You don’t want to choose a   digital/online community that you are too close/attached   to, because you   need the   distance to analyse your   research.
•   Observe   the digital/online community’s mediated practices and   processes   over   a period of time.   Ideally, you will observe your chosen community   over   4-5 weeks.
You can   look out for practices of care and   support,   processes   of   content/   participant moderation, power struggles and   hierarchies,   languages of   identiﬁcation and/or   representation, gender,   racial, and class dynamics, structures of social   relations, etc. You want to focus on how   digital   media   technologies   (websites, blogs, platforms, etc.) are affording   or   enabling   particular social practices and   processes, and   how   online   community
members are engaging digital technologies for social   (and/or political)   effects.
•   Participate   in a digital/online   community
Engage with the community online   (again, it’s helpful   if you   have   some   experience with this community already). Comment and post,   attend   livestreams, virtual sessions, make your own content that relates   to   the online community and share it with them   (if that   might   be   an option).   You   need to participate   in order to meaningfully   understand   and,   perhaps,   experience how digital media technologies and social   relations   shape   each other.
•   ETHICAL   considerations are crucial!
Please introduce yourself and your   research project for this course   clearly   to the community members. Tell them that you’re working on a   ﬁnal assignment 代 写Anthro 3040 Final Assignment: Oral Exam and Final Project VideoHaskell
代做程序编程语言on digital communities. You must get community   members’   consent to observe their online interactions, and   include these interactions   in your ﬁnal project only.   Please   note: You cannot use their   collected data beyond this ﬁnal project!   Please document this consent   in   a   written or oral form. - you can take a   screenshot,   have   it   in   an   email,   a   Word/PDF document, or take an audio   recording. You must   also   offer to   record their participation anonymously   (i.e. your   research must not   include any personal identiﬁable information   about   community   members,      such as names, age, ethnicity,   linguistic or cultural   or   geographical   or   any   personal background, gender identity, etc.),   if they   so   require.
2.      Semi-structured   Interviews
•   If you have the opportunity to do so, conduct   semi-structured   interviews with   a   few participants   (3-5 people). There are a   number of ways   to   conduct   semi-structured interviews. You can share a   list of questions with   the   community      members prior to the interview to provide them with   a   general   framework   of   your conversation - you can also expand   on the   listed   questions,   ask follow-up   questions, or add more questions during the   interview   itself.   During the   interview, you can make notes about   non-verbal communication,   such   as   tone   of voice,   record other behavior. details, such as gestures,   pauses,   emotions   in   the interview that are also   important   for communication.
Structure of the   Final video project
-      Topic
Your video will start by talking about your topic, your choice   of   online   community,   and   what you are studying in this   online   community.
-      Research methods
You will talk about how you collected your data,   including consent   from   community members. You can specify   (or show images of) the   accounts or   groups   or   pages   you   followed, maybe include the amount of time you   spent   on following   them,   and   the   kinds   of ways you participated in the online community;   i.e. through   events   (such   as   livestreams, or   real-time video games you played), posts and   comments,   etc.   If   you conducted semi-structured   interviews, you can also talk about   how   many   people you   spoke with and the kinds of   questions you   asked.
-      Research   Data    Findings
Here you will talk about the data you collected and what you   learnt from   it. The   assignment asks you to   think about how digital   media technologies   and   social   relations   are shaped by each other. Your digital   research on   a   particular   community will   help   you   to answer this assignment question.
Your video will show   your research ﬁndings through screenshots, or video   or   audio   clips/ recordings, or interview answers   (if available).   Remember you need   to   show   visually your   research.
-      Research Analysis
Your video will   have analysis of the   research data.   In your   research data,   how are   digital   media and social   relations shaped by each other? You   can   analyse   your   data   using   4-5      readings and/or concepts from the course.   Here you might   look   at the   reading   by   Ruha Benjamin on   race and technology to talk about   racial dynamics, or the   reading   by Arjun Appadurai to talk about global media cultures, or the   reading   by   Helga Tawil-Souri   to talk about digital media and settler-colonial occupation, to   name   a   few   examples.   You will show examples from your   research data and   link it   to   the   readings.   Readings   can   be   cited   by the authors names, such   as   Ruha   Benjamin’s   reading on   Captivating   Technology.
